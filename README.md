# EcoBee---TPLink-SmartPlug-Control

**IMPORTANT NOTE -- THIS PROJECT VERSION IS OUT OF DATE AND MAY NO LONGER BE FUNCTIONAL.  CURRENTLY WORKING ON GETTING A NEW PUBLICLY AVAILABLE VERSION WITH SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVED FEATURES UP ON GITHUB.  THANKS FOR YOUR PATIENCE!**

Control TPLink smart plugs with EcoBee sensor data

heatrun.py is used to control multiple electric space heaters on TPLink smartplugs based on temperature data from EcoBee remote sensors.

You are solely responsible for safe operation of your space heaters.  In particular, ensure that your heaters are configured to turn themselves off at a safe high limit temperature.  Do not depend on this program to do so.  This program is not intended to be "fail safe" and may crash / exit with the smart plugs turned on.

The program will autodetect all controllable "rooms".  A "room" is defined by having both an Ecobee remote sensor and a smart plug with (exactly) the same name.  Just give the sensor and the plug the same name in the Ecobee and Kasa apps, respectively.  Note - this autodiscovery only works if run locally (inside LAN).  

Supports text message push for issues / events -- must have Twilio account to use this feature.

Integrates with Ohmconnect to respond to Ohmconnect events -- must have Ohmconnect account to use this feature

auth.py needs to be updated with keys -- ecobee developer api key, twilio keys & phone numbers, and ohmconnect URL.  You will need to set yourself up as a developer on the ecobee site to get the api key.

Before using heatrun.py for the first time, or if tokens have expired, use the new_tokens.py utility to issue EcoBee tokens and create / update the tokens.txt file where access and refresh tokens are stored.  The utility requests an authorization PIN, this is issued from the Ecobee customer portal (under the My Apps) section when you authorize a new app.

Once the tokens.txt file is created for the first time (with valid tokens), heatrun.py will refresh these tokens.

NEW Schedule file.  For now this is manually edited (see notes on this file).  It is a step towards a scheduling GUI.

NEW Rooms can be designated as being "rotated".  This means that only one room within this group can be on at a time.  If multiple rooms are calling for heat simultaneously, they will be switched on and off in sequence.  In some cases this is needed to avoid overloading a breaker, for example.  This functionality existed in older code but had an idiosyncratic implementation, it is now much more generalized.  You do have to go into the code to change the names of the rooms in this list if you want them to be rotated.  The cleaner implementation is also a step towards adding a GUI.
